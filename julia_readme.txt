INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING MATLAB CODE

* DEVELOPMENT MODE

	* Run julia_playground.m with holdout set to a nonzero value (~20)
	
	* Run julia_test.m to see how the trained model performs on the holdout data

* SUBMISSION MODE

	* Run julia_playground.m with holdout=0 
	(We want to use all the training data for our final model) 
	
	* Run julia_submission.m to generate csv
